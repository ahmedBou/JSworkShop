        It's a button that when you try and click it it moves out of the way and you have to wrangle it.
        You have to corner it into a corner or a small space in order to actually click it and defeat it.
        So when you get near that as soon as you mouse over that button It's going to move.
        So you can't click because it will be gone before you can click.
