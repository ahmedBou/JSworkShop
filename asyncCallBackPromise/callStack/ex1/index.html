    <h1>Call Stack</h1>
    <p>The very first function call that the javascript interpreter hits or reaches will be added to the call
        stack that function will be carried out.
        And if there are any other function calls within that first function they will be added to the top of
        the call stack.
        And that continues until one of those functions returns a value at which point it's removed from the
        stack.
        It's gone.
        And then the function that came before it will hopefully finish maybe there are some other function
        calls in which case those are added to the top of the stack and then removed or popped off as they complete.

        I think this will become clear if we have an example.

        So on the left I have a couple different functions.

        The first one is called is right triangle.

        It accepts three different arguments a B and C three different numbers.

        And it should return true if a and b if we square them and add them together you get C squared.

        A squared plus b squared equals c squared.

        So if something is a right triangle the third value here C would be the hypotenuse.

        These two would be the other side's K remember what they're called.

        But we have two sides on a triangle and then the hypotenuse in a right triangle.

        So nine would be three times three sixteen four times four in twenty five five times five.

        And that indeed would be a real right triangle nine plus sixteen does equal twenty five.

        Okay.

        So is right triangle is not a function that just returns something immediately it needs to call other

        functions.

        It's going to return if the square of a plus the square of B is triple equals to the square of C so

        square of a needs to be called and that in turn calls multiply x times x.

        So we pass in three multiply three times three which is a different function which returns to values

        the product of them.

        So when the interpreter encounters the very first function call is right triangle three four or five

        it's added to the call stack which is what I'm representing over here and we can't just get a value

        back immediately.

        There are multiple function calls in here that happen first.

        So square of a which is three in our case square of three we'll be the first thing to be added to the
 
        call stack which is what this side is square of three does not turn anything either.
  
        It calls a different function.

        Multiply three comma three which I'm showing here.

        So then multiply is added to the stack.

        So this function has not finished running.

        This one has not finished.

        This one doesn't call any other functions so it returns three times three which is nine.

        And when it returns a value it is removed from the stack.

        The last thing in is the first thing out.

        So then square of three.

        Now has a value back from multiply which was nine.

        So it can return that value.
  
        So it's popped off now we end up with is right triangle.

        That's the current function that is being executed.

        It's been waiting a while because those I mean a while it's relative.

        But I had to wait for two other function calls to return.

        So now you can kind of fill in the blanks here.

        The first part square of a square of three is nine.

        We have a value.

        Then it moves on.

        All right.

        Is there another function call.

        Yep there is.

        Square of four which is B so square of B so square is added to the top of the call stack.

        And when I say top it's not really a top and bottom situation it's just a data structure.

        Think of it kind of like an array but much simpler.

        But I'm just using top and bottom here to help explain visually what's going on.

        Like a stack of books.

        So square a four doesn't return a value right away at least it has to call multiply for column A four.

        So that's added to the top of the stack that does return a value X times Y four times for 16.

        So that pops off the stack then square off for now has a value for this.

        It fills in that blank sixteen which means that it's done because it returns sixteen and then we fill

        in the blank in is right triangle.

        We now have this done this done.

        And then we have our triple equals square of C square five.
        

        So five is added to the call stack that doesn't return a value yet it has to figure out what multiply

        a five comma five is.

        So that is the next function call added to the call stack that returns twenty five which means that
    
        square now has value.

        So both of those are popped off and then we end up with twenty five here no more function calls.

        Now just some simple math.

        And actually the order here it probably evaluates this first anyway nine plus 16.

        It doesn't actually matter here.

        We're just talking about function calls but we end up with nine for sixteen triple equals twenty five.

        That is true.

        So this function finally returns true at least in this case and it is popped off the stack call stack
        

        is empty.

        It returns true and we're done.
 
        So that is a brief intro to the call stack in the next video I'll show you an example of how you can
        actually see it using the dev tools or at least a representation of it with your own code and you can

        step through it step by step.

        All right.

        So let's do that next.
